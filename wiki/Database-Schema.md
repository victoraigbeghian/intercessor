# Database Schema

Intercessor creates six custom tables using the [BerlinDB](https://github.com/berlindb/core) library. All tables use the WordPress table prefix (e.g., `wp_intercessor_prayer_requests`). Each table stores its schema version in the `wp_options` table under the key `{table_name}_db_version`.

## Querying Data

Each table has a corresponding Query class in `Intercessor\Database\Query\` that extends BerlinDB's base Query. Example:

```php
use Intercessor\Database\Query\Prayer_Request_Query;

$query = new Prayer_Request_Query();

// Get approved requests, newest first
$results = $query->query( [
    'status'  => 'approved',
    'orderby' => 'date_created',
    'order'   => 'DESC',
    'number'  => 10,
] );
```

Row objects are typed instances of classes in `Intercessor\Database\Row\` with property access for each column.
